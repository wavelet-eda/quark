# Quark 
`*.qk`

Quark is an independent HDL language using a syntax largely inspired by SystemVerilog but with a dramatically improved type system and purely sequential event ordering paradigm. While no behavior across clock cycles is inferred by the language compiler, modern language features like Rust's ownership model help to make hardware programming more flexible and easier to see design intent. The compiler is written in Go and supports a variety of language targets, including simulation code and netlists in a variety of formats.
